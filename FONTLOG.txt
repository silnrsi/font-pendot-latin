FONTLOG for the Andika Pendot fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Andika Pendot Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Andika Pendot fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Andika Pendot is a prototype set of fonts for writing education in the Latin script. It is incomplete and will change considerably. Please do not use this as a source of derivatives. A much more useful font will eventually be released that will be a better source. Thank you!
